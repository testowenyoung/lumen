You can use it to rapidly build Express.js applications on AWS Lambda and AWS HTTP API, to deliver an API that auto-scales massively, and only charges you when it runs ($0.0000002 and $0.0000009 per request).</p>\n<p>Here are the new features of the GA release, which you can use with Serverless Express and other Components, like <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless-components/website\">Serverless Website</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless-components/aws-dynamodb\">AWS DynamoDB</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless-components\">more</a>…</p>\n<h2>Fast Deployments</h2>\n<p>When it comes to development, speed is a killer feature.</p>\n<p>Serverless Components is now powered by our innovative Components Engine, which performs all deployments, and reduces deployment time to under 8 seconds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/2020-04-02-serverless-components-ga/artwork-serverless-components-ga-1.png\" alt=\"Serverless Components Fast Deployments\"></p>\n<p>With fast deployments, it becomes much easier to develop directly on real cloud services, rather than maintain a local emulation of those services.</p>\n<p>Now, you can develop on the same cloud infrastructure your application will use in production, without compromising on development velocity.</p>\n<h2>Dev Mode</h2>\n<p>Getting logs from cloud services while developing on them has previously been slow and difficult.</p>\n<p>Serverless Components features a new “Dev Mode”, which speeds up the feedback cycle during development, just run <code class=\"language-text\">serverless dev</code> in your Component.</p>\n<p>First, “Dev Mode” watches your code, detects changes and auto-deploys it rapidly using our Components Engine.</p>\n<p>Second, when you interact with your application using “Dev Mode”, transactions, logs and errors stream from your application to your CLI in real-time.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/2020-04-02-serverless-components-ga/artwork-serverless-components-ga-2.png\" alt=\"Serverless Dev Mode\"></p>\n<p>It looks and feels as fast as if your application is running locally.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Functionality</h2>\n<p>Every Component is rich in advanced functionality.</p>\n<p>For example, the Express Component can set up a custom domain for you, as well as a free AWS ACM SSL certificate.</p>\n<p>This Component also ships with canary deployment support, so you can roll out code changes that affect a subset of your HTTP requests.  Just merge in your new experimental code, and set the percentage of requests you wish for it to receive.</p>\n<p>Every Component now stores its state automatically in the cloud, so you can easily collaborate on them and run them in CI/CD.</p>\n<p>Components also feature better support for staging. Pass in a <code class=\"language-text\">--stage</code> flag to deploy a separate instance of your Component.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Components export outputs, which are saved in the cloud and therefore easy to reference as inputs for other Components.  You can even use outputs from Components in different stages.</p>\n<p>Components are free to use with the Serverless Framework.
