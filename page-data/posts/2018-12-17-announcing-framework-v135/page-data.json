This makes it easier to pass in test payloads and quickly iterate locally.</p>\n<p>An important note, you will want to make sure you are running a Ruby version equal to AWS Lambda’s runtime (as of this writing, it is <code class=\"language-text\">2.5</code>). macOS system Ruby likely will NOT work properly.</p>\n<h5>AWS <code class=\"language-text\">${cf}</code> syntax now supports outputs from other regions</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5579\">PR #5579</a>, thank you <a href=\"https://github.com/exoego\">TATSUNO Yasuhiro - @exoego</a></p>\n<p>Often, you’ll want to centralize configs in CloudFormation outputs, making them easy to access for use in other services. However, this becomes complex in the case that you want to have a multi-region service, or otherwise regionally distributed services.</p>\n<p>This feature addition makes it so you can optionally specify a region to look at for outputs, allowing cross-region resolution of the outputs. Usage is as simple as<code class=\"language-text\">${cf.REGION:stackName.outputKey}</code>. For example, <code class=\"language-text\">${cf.us-east-2:my-service-dev.kinesisStreamArn}</code>.</p>\n<p>Check out the docs for more information on <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/variables#reference-cloudformation-outputs\">CloudFormation output usage</a> in the variable resolution system.</p>\n<h4>Enhancements</h4>\n<h5>Faster exclusion of files during packaging</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5574\">PR #5574</a>, thank you <a href=\"https://github.com/MacMcIrish\">Jeff Soloshy - @MacMcirish</a>.</p>\n<p>You may know that you can exclude various things from being packaged, including dev only packages in <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code>. You can <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/packaging/#exclude--include\">check out the docs</a> for more info.</p>\n<p>This could be a slow process if you had a large project with many dependencies. According to Jeff, when running package on “a project with a large file count with many dev dependencies. The difference in timing is ~30s compared to ~15 minutes.” - <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5574#issue-236643438\">github</a>. WOW!</p>\n<h4>Bug fixes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5562\">PR #5563</a> <code class=\"language-text\">logRententionInDays</code> regression fix, once again parses strings to integers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5566\">PR #5566</a> Set reserved function concurrency even if it was set to 0.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5565\">PR #5565</a> Set env vars from —env last in invoke local, allowing for more intuitive overrides.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5571\">PR #5571</a> Preserve whitespace in variable fallback</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/5587\">PR #5587</a> Upgrade to aws-sdk v2.373.0. Fixes SDK bugs aws-sdk package had with using profiles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Roadmap &#x26; focus</h4>\n<p>We are focusing our internal efforts on eliminating regressions, and tackling the backlog of bugs.
