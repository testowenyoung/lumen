Since then we’ve been working towards simplifying the process of moving applications between cloud providers to enable the development of multi-cloud Serverless apps. All while keeping the Serverless workflow and developer experience consistent across providers so you don’t need to learn custom commands or syntax for each platform.</p>\n<p>OpenWhisk integration <a href=\"https://serverless.com/blog/openwhisk-integration-with-serverless/\">launched earlier this year</a>. The official OpenWhisk provider plugin allows developers to build, deploy and manage apps running on the OpenWhisk platform using the Serverless Framework. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Special shout out to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomasj\">James Thomas (@thomasj)</a> at IBM for his awesome contribution spearheading this effort!</em></strong></p>\n<p>OpenWhisk recently released <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless-openwhisk/releases/tag/v0.5.0\">v0.5.0 of the plugin</a>, adding support for <a href=\"https://cloudant.com/\">Cloudant DB</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/message-hub/\">IBM Message Hub</a> events, <a href=\"https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/webactions.md\">exporting Web Actions</a> and local OpenWhisk deployments.</p>\n<img width=\"1028\" alt=\"openwhisk banner\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20538501/24154626/b86ad64a-0e1f-11e7-8e12-979b8d194430.png\">\n<h3>Use the following command to upgrade the provider plugin to the latest version.</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npm update -g serverless-openwhisk</code></pre></div>\n<p><em>Due to an <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/2895\">outstanding issue</a> with provider plugins, the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless-openwhisk\">OpenWhisk provider</a> must be installed as a global module.</em></p>\n<h3>New Features Supported in v0.5.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IBM Message Hub Events</strong> - Functions can be bound to events from IBM Message Hub (“Apache Kafka”-as-a-Service) using a new event type (<em>message_hub</em>). Functions will be fired with the batch of messages received since the last invocation. Service credentials can be automatically read from an OpenWhisk package. Learn more <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/openwhisk/events/messagehub/\">in the docs</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>IBM Cloudant DB Events</strong> - Functions can be bound to events from IBM Cloudant (“CouchDB”-as-a-Service) using a new event type (<em>cloudant</em>). Functions are invoked for each database modification surfaced through the CouchDB <em>_changes</em> feed. Service credentials can be automatically read from an OpenWhisk package. Learn more <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/openwhisk/events/cloudant/\">in the docs</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Export Web Actions</strong> - Functions can be turned into [“<em>web actions</em>”] which return HTTP content without use of an API Gateway. This feature is enabled by setting an annotation (<code class=\"language-text\">web-export</code>) in the configuration file. Learn more <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/openwhisk/guide/web-actions/\">in the docs</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Support Local OpenWhisk Deployments</strong> - This plugin now supports targeting OpenWhisk instances without valid SSL certificates. Developers running personal instances of the platform often do not have a custom SSL certificate set up for their domain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the milestone <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless-openwhisk/milestone/1?closed=1\">release on GitHub</a> or the <a href=\"https://medium.com/openwhisk/updated-openwhisk-support-in-the-serverless-framework-62d1c3d7c112#.s6pivymqo\">OpenWhisk blog</a> for full details on the new features and bug fixes.
