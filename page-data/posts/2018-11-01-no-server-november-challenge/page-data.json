Automating anything to do with GitHub is just incredibly useful.</p>\n<p>For the easy version, set up a GitHub check that makes sure there’s a reference to a GitHub / Jira / etc issue in the PR title. For the harder version, set up a GitHub check to automatically lint &#x26; reformat your code on a new commit.</p>\n<p>Or, do something else fun.

We’ll also include some resources to get you started. The final week of November, we’ll have a special edition re:Invent hackathon instead.</p>\n<p>Find a challenge you like! Or better yet, find multiple challenges you like! You can enter separately for every challenge you complete, and you can complete any challenge at any time.</p>\n<p>Do the challenge. Put it in GitHub. Tweet a link to your repo, plus any other relevant links or screenshots, with the hashtag #NoServerNovember. </p>\n<p>Each entry qualifies you to win a prize. We will draw three winners every week, and we don’t remove you from the pool until you win a prize. So if you complete a challenge during week 1, you could be in the drawing for weeks 2 and 3 as well. All the more reason to start early!</p>\n<p>Draw dates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nov. 12</li>\n<li>Nov. 19</li>\n<li>Nov. 26</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Rules</h4>\n<p>To qualify, the entry must use the Serverless Framework and a serverless backend (such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Microsoft Azure).</p>\n<p>You may only enter one time per daily challenge. You can, however, complete as many daily challenges as you want, and those will count as separate entries.</p>\n<p>You must follow any additional instructions contained within the challenge descriptions to have your entry counted.\nOnly entries that use the hashtag #noServerNovember will be qualified to win.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"No Server November: Join the #noServerNovember challenge!","date":"November 01, 2018","description":"All November, we're posting a series of serverless challenges.
