With the OpenWhisk integration, developers using the framework can choose to deploy their Serverless apps to any OpenWhisk platform instance. Further, multi-provider support simplifies the process of moving applications between cloud providers and enables the development of multi-cloud Serverless apps.</p>\n<p>The Serverless workflow and developer experience is consistent across all providers. You don’t need to learn custom commands or syntax for each platform.</p>\n<h2>Resources for Getting Started</h2>\n<p><em>Check out these resources to help you get started with OpenWhisk integration.</em></p>\n<h3>Intro to the OpenWhisk Serverless Plugin Video</h3>\n<p>Learn more about how to use the Serverless Framework with the new OpenWhisk provider plugin in this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GJY10W98Itc\">quick video</a>.</p>\n<h3>Serverless Docs</h3>\n<p>OpenWhisk is now included in the <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/\">Serverless Docs</a>. You’ll find a guide to building Serverless applications, CLI command reference, platform event support and an example application.</p>\n<h3>Serverless Examples Repository</h3>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/examples\">Serverless Examples repository</a> to see more sample applications. OpenWhisk examples include: how to build HTTP APIs, cron-based schedulers, chaining functions and more.</p>\n<h2>Let Us Know What You Think</h2>\n<p>For months we’ve been collaborating with the OpenWhisk team to ensure a great user experience and seamless integration. Let us know what you think. Community feedback is a driving force in the direction of the Serverless Framework.</p>\n<p>You can report bugs or request features by opening an issue in the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless-openwhisk\">Serverless-OpenWhisk repository</a>.
