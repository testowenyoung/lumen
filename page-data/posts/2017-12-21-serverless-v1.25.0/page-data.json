Yes, please!</p>\n<p>This feature adds <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html\">S3 Transfer Acceleration</a> support for uploading your deployment packages to S3. Rather than uploading to your region’s origin for S3, it uploads the package to CloudFront edge locations and quickly transfers it to S3.</p>\n<p>To enable this new feature, use the <code class=\"language-text\">--aws-s3-accelerate</code> flag when deploying your service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">$ sls deploy --aws-s3-accelerate</code></pre></div>\n<p>In testing, we’ve seen huge speedups in package uploads. In an example test, this was <strong>42%</strong> faster than using the normal S3 upload for someone located in the target AWS region. When uploading to a different region (e.g. from Italy to us-west-2), we saw <strong>10x</strong> speedups! ⚡️</p>\n<p>Much thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex_casalboni\">Alex Casalboni</a> for adding this feature!</p>\n<h3>API Gateway Endpoint Type Configuration</h3>\n<p>AWS recently announced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-api-gateway-supports-regional-api-endpoints/\">regional endpoints</a> for API Gateway. These endpoints are accessed from the same region where your API Gateway REST API is deployed. This enables a lot of interesting use cases, including multi-region Serverless applications with lower latency or the ability to use AWS WAF with your API Gateway REST APIs.</p>\n<p>You can enable this feature using the <code class=\"language-text\">endpointType</code> property in the <code class=\"language-text\">provider</code> block of your <code class=\"language-text\">serverless.yml</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yml\"><pre class=\"language-yml\"><code class=\"language-yml\"><span class=\"token comment\"># serverless.yml</span>\n\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">provider</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> aws\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">endpointType</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> regional\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">...</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Serverless defaults to an EDGE endpoint, which was the standard before AWS released regional endpoints.</p>\n<h3>Improved variable processing</h3>\n<p>For power users of the Framework, the variable resolution could cause some issues. There are a number of bug fixes related to the variable system including <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/4144\">support for circular references</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/4499\">few</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/4294\">different</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/4518\">PRs</a> to better handle resolving variables that call out to external services like CloudFormation, SSM, or S3.</p>\n<p>These are huge improvements to the power and stability of the Framework, and they’re difficult to implement in a consistent, non-breaking way. We appreciate the hard work of our community members in these fixes, particularly Framework core maintainer <a href=\"https://github.com/HyperBrain\">Frank Schmid</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/e-e-e\">Benjamin Forster</a>, and long-time user <a href=\"https://github.com/erikerikson\">Erik Erikson</a>. Be sure to thank these fine folks for their contributions!</p>\n<h3>Other enhancements &#x26; bug fixes</h3>\n<p>This release also includes tons of other improvements and bug fixes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank you very much for reporting bugs, opening issues and joining the discussions!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We hope that you enjoy this release!
