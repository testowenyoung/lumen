Want to participate? Awesome. Read on for the challenge description and details.</p>\n<p>The deadline to submit your project is <strong>Sunday, Dec 2</strong> at 11:00pm PT! So you’ve got all week.</p>\n<p>(Note that this hackathon isn’t in direct partnership with AWS, it’s just a fun thing <a href=\"https://serverless.com/\">Serverless</a> is doing alongside re:Invent.)</p>\n<h4>The hackathon challenge</h4>\n<p>It’s #GivingTuesday. As a community, let’s help AWS’s Andrew Jassy fulfill his newest mission: putting a cat in every home in America.</p>\n<p>Jassy’s newest non-profit, Amazon Feline, is seeking to help match cats with new homes and offering free relocation for each pet adopted. </p>\n<p>This year, we’re going to work together to ensure Jassy has everything he needs to build a successful non-profit just in time for AWS re:Invent. You’re probably wondering, “How can I help?”</p>\n<p>With a Serverless app, of course. Or a <a href=\"https://serverless.com/blog/what-are-serverless-components-how-use/\">new component</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/plugins\">plugin</a>, or <a href=\"https://serverless.com/examples/\">example</a> to help get the non-profit up and running.</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong> This scenario is all in good fun, and Amazon Feline is not an actual AWS-sponsored hackathon or non-profit initiative. However! We do plan to take your projects and create replicable applications and repos that non-profits around the world can use to help promote their own missions.</p>\n<p>Some ideas include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://serverless.com/examples/aws-node-stripe-integration/\">payment gateway</a> for adoption fees</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://serverless.com/examples/aws-node-twilio-send-text-message/\">text or email app</a> to send pictures of cats to Amazon customers identified as currently catless</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://serverless.com/blog/how-to-create-landing-page-with-serverless-components\">website for the organization</a></li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://serverless.com/blog/3rd-party-rest-api-to-graphql-serverless/\">photo-editing app</a> to help new pet families share their pics</li>\n<li>A chatbot that shares interesting cat facts</li>\n<li>Or <a href=\"https://serverless.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-alexa-skills-with-serverless\">an IoT project</a> to automate pet-related chores</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The sky is truly the limit. Make whatever your heart desires, as long as it fits the theme.</p>\n<h4>How to enter</h4>\n<p>You can win an Amazon Echo, Serverless swag, or other goodies! Just make sure to follow the submission guidelines for your entry to be counted:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tweet the link to your GitHub repo and a screenshot of your project in action, if applicable.</li>\n<li>Include the hashtags #reInvent2018 &#x26; #NoServerNovember.</li>\n<li>Mention @goserverless.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, you should totally submit your finished project to our <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/examples\">Examples Repo</a> as well, where it will stand a pretty good chance of getting featured on our website in the <a href=\"https://serverless.com/examples/\">Examples Explorer</a>.</p>\n<h4>Rules</h4>\n<p>To qualify, the entry must use the Serverless Framework and AWS Lambda.</p>\n<p>These projects will all be open-sourced to help other charitable organizations clone, modify, or expand upon to grow their own reach.</p>\n<h5>Winners</h5>\n<p>Winners will be hand-picked by the Serverless team. We will judge entries based on their relevance to the theme, as well as the project’s broader applications for non-profits.</p>\n<h4>More #NoServerNovember fun</h4>\n<p>We kind of took over November this year with a month-long series of Serverless challenges!
