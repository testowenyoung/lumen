Lots of valuable feedback and suggestions were <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/milestone/11?closed=1\">submitted and discussed</a> since then. Thanks to the help of our great community we’re proud to announce our first beta release today: <strong>Serverless V1.0-beta.1</strong> Let’s take a closer look what has changed / is new.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYDmaD1UUsc\">Features Overview Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weOsx5rLWX0\">Getting Started Video</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Multi language support</h2>\n<p>Up until now Serverless only supported Node.js as a runtime and JavaScript as the corresponding programming language. In Serverless v1.0-Beta.1 you’ll be able to use Node.js, Python 2.7 or Java (via Gradle or Maven) as a runtime for your projects. Using these new runtimes is easy and you’re already familiar with how to create a service through the new runtimes. Just use the <strong>create</strong> command with the <strong>aws-java-maven</strong> template parameter to e.g. create a new Java (via Maven) based service on AWS:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">serverless create --template aws-java-maven</code></pre></div>\n<p>To see a list of available templates and options for creating a new service run</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">serverless create --help</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can also change the runtime of existing services by updating the <strong>provider runtime</strong> attribute in <strong>serverless.yml</strong> like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yaml\"><pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">provider</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> aws\n  runtime<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> java8</code></pre></div>\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/docs/service-templates\">service templates docs</a> to see how you can use the other templates. A big “Thank you!” goes out to <a href=\"https://github.com/license2e\">Ilya Shindyapin (@license2e)</a> who took the time to get Java support into Serverless. <em>See <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1247\">#1247</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1552\">#1552</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1554\">#1554</a> (Python support), <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1246\">#1246</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1553\">#1553</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1672\">#1672</a> (Java support)</em></p>\n<h2>API Gateway updates</h2>\n<p>The API Gateway event source is one of the most used and most complex event sources out there. There are many things one can configure. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/plugins/aws/deploy/compile/events/apiGateway\">API Gateway documentation</a> to see how you can use all those new settings. <em>See <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1594\">#1594</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1620\">#1620</a> (Custom Authorizers), <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1598\">#1598</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1603\">#1603</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1666\">#1666</a> (Proxy settings), <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1595\">#1595</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1636\">#1636</a> (API keys)</em></p>\n<h2>VPC support</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you want to configure your lambda functions so that they can be operated in a VPC environment. This feature was also added to the beta 1 release! Take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v1.0/docs/guide/deploying-a-service.md#deploying-vpc-configuration-for-lambda\">the documentation</a> to see how you can setup the corresponding configuration parameters so that your lambda function can be operated in a VPC environment. <em>See <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1489\">#1489</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1705\">#1705</a></em></p>\n<h2>Developer plugins / tooling</h2>\n<p>Our mission for the Serverless framework is to provide an easy to use, yet powerful tool which helps you as a developer while working on your Serverless services and projects. Tedious tasks / configurations should be abstracted away so that you can focus on your code and be more productive. A feature rich toolset which supports you in your day to day development is vital here. Because of that we’ve <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1582\">started the discussion</a> with the community what kind of developer tooling plugins are of interest and needed to be more productive while working with Serverless. V1.0-Beta.1 includes the following plugins which will help you develop your Serverless services:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/plugins/aws/info\">Info plugin </a>Prints out what resources are deployed to AWS</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/plugins/aws/logs\">Logs plugin </a>See all your functions logs and browse through them on your console (supports tailing as well)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/master/lib/plugins/aws/deployFunction\">Single function deployment </a>Blazing fast way to deploy a single function of your service (e.g. to test recent changes on a cloud provider infrastructure)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Big thank you to <a href=\"https://github.com/bennybauer\">Benny Bauer (@bennybauer)</a> who implemented the whole info plugin! What plugins do you need for your daily work? Any ideas or thoughts? Please let us know and jump into the discussion <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1582\">here</a>. <em>See <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1582\">#1582</a> (main discussion), <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1468\">#1468</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1590\">#1590</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1708\">#1708</a> (info plugin), <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1654\">#1654</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1691\">#1691</a> (logs plugin), <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1652\">#1652</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1696\">#1696</a> (single function deployment plugin)</em></p>\n<h2>.yaml and .yml support</h2>\n<p>YAMLs <a href=\"http://www.yaml.org/faq.html\">official file extension</a> is .yaml which we’ve supported right from the beginning. However .yml is used often due to its brevity. Serverless V1.0-Beta.1 will now support both file extensions (.yaml and .yml). The default Serverless will choose (e.g. upon service creation) is .yml and we recommend that you switch to this file extension. <em>See <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1186\">#1168</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1342\">#1342</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/1681\">#1681</a></em></p>\n<h2>Documentation updates, bug fixes and v1 as the main version</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/\">The documentation</a> is a key piece for every software project. Without it (or with poor documentation) developers won’t be able to use the product and can’t work with it. In this beta 1 release we’ve updated our documentation with new examples, sections for new functionality and many different minor fixes. We would like to hear your feedback on our docs. What do you think is missing? Should we consider another structure? Please chime in on <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/1522\">this issue</a> and let us know what you think! Additional to the documentation updates we’ve also fixed a bunch of nasty bugs so that Serverless is way more stable and reliable. That’s why we’ve decided to merge the v1.0 branch into the master branch and mark v0 as deprecated. Serverless v1 is now the go to version when you’re about to work on a new project or want to get started with Serverless.</p>\n<h2>A big thanks to our contributors!</h2>\n<p>We’ve seen a dramatic increase in contributions the past months and would like to use this blog post to say <strong>thank you</strong> to the community for all the work they’ve done to make Serverless great!
