We also have the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway\">Event Gateway</a>, plus <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/plugins\">plugins</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/examples\">examples</a> repositories.</p>\n<p>We have user-contributed plugins that do everything from enabling canary deployments to mitigating cold starts. We have detailed examples for Go runtime usage and GraphQL implementations. Writing a cool new Serverless plugin or example is immensely beneficial to the community.</p>\n<p>In terms of non-code ways you can pitch in: Review someone else’s code. Add an existing plugin or example to the list if it isn’t already there. We love all of these things.</p>\n<p>Sometimes our docs have typos or need updates; if you see an opportunity for improvement, then click the edit button. We love that too. (Just as an FYI, you can even do that on our blog!)</p>\n<img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/serverless-contribute/edit-button.png\">\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, new people try serverless all the time, and they have questions as they figure things out. Visit <a href=\"shttps://forum.serverless.com/\">the forums</a> and answer a question today. You’ll be directly giving back to the community, and perhaps even learning some new things yourself in the process.</p>\n<h3>Issues and Pull Requests</h3>\n<p>See something in the Framework or Event Gateway that you want to fix or change? Create an issue first.</p>\n<p>That way, we can talk to you about solutions before you spend a lot of time on a PR.</p>\n<h4>Understanding labels</h4>\n<p>We use labels to categorize our issues and PRs, and you can filter by these as you search:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help wanted: issues or pull requests that need special attention</li>\n<li>Good first issue: special areas where first-time contributors can jump in</li>\n<li>Needs feedback: if you want to contribute by providing feedback</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Milestones</h4>\n<p>Want to know when the newest Framework is being released? It all depends on the milestones.</p>\n<p>Here, for example, is our <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/milestone/42\">1.27 milestone</a>:</p>\n<img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/serverless-contribute/127-milestone.png\">\n<p>v1.27 gets released when all the issues are closed and pull requests are reviewed and merged.</p>\n<h2>Get started!</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues\">Check out Framework issues</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway/issues\">Check out Event Gateway issues</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/plugins\">Add a plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/examples\">Add an example</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.serverless.com/\">Answer a forum question</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other helpful resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://serverless.com/blog/writing-serverless-plugins/\">How to write your first plugin for the Serverless Framework</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://serverless.com/blog/most-popular-framework-plugins/\">The most popular Framework plugins</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to contribute to Serverless open source projects","date":"March 19, 2018","description":"Interested in contributing to Serverless open source projects?
