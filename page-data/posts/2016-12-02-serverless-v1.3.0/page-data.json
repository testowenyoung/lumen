You can find a list with all the updates in the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog</a>.</p>\n<h3>Function Metrics</h3>\n<p>Ever wondered how your functions are performing? The new <code class=\"language-text\">serverless metrics</code> allows you to see all the function metrics, such as invocations, throttles, errors, and duration, at a glance.</p>\n<p>Just type</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">serverless metrics --function myFunction</code></pre></div>\n<p>to see the metrics of the last 24h for your function <code class=\"language-text\">myFunction</code>.</p>\n<p>You can even specify the timeframe you want to see for the metrics with the <code class=\"language-text\">startTime</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">endTime</code> options.</p>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">serverless metrics --function myFunction --startTime <span class=\"token number\">2016</span>-11-28 --endTime <span class=\"token number\">2016</span>-12-02</code></pre></div>\n<p>will show you all the metrics between Nov. 28th and Dec. 2nd.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the new metrics functionality in <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/metrics/\">the documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>AWS Credentials Setup</h3>\n<p>Setting up credentials should be streamlined in the overall Serverless experience. V1.3 adds a new command called <code class=\"language-text\">serverless config credentials</code> that helps you setup your AWS credentials on your local machine.</p>\n<p>This example will setup the <code class=\"language-text\">default</code> AWS profile with the provided key and secret:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">serverless config credentials --provider aws --key someKey --secret someSecret</code></pre></div>\n<p>No need to configure the <code class=\"language-text\">credentials</code> file through the <code class=\"language-text\">aws-cli</code> anymore.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the new config functionality in <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/config/\">the documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Lambda Versioning</h3>\n<p>Serverless now supports automatic Lambda versioning with the help of the built-in Lambda versions AWS provides.</p>\n<p>Keeping a history of all of your deployed Lambda functions is an important feature. AWS will now use your Lambda version in the logs, as well. This makes it way easier to track down bugs.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to change anything. Just deploy your service as usual and Serverless will version your Lambda functions from now on.</p>\n<h3>Refactorings and Bug Fixes</h3>\n<p>We’ve also fixed a bunch of bugs (thanks for bringing them up!), and have continued our process of <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/2645\">codebase refactorings</a> so that it’s easier for new contributors to get on board.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>We’ve already started filling in the next <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/milestones\">milestones</a>. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/milestone/18\">1.4 milestone</a> to see what you can expect in two weeks.</p>\n<p>We hope that you have fun with the new release! Let us know if you have any questions or feedback in <a href=\"http://forum.serverless.com/\">our Forum</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues\">GitHub Issues</a>.</p>\n<h3>Using Semver</h3>\n<p>Note that we’re using <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">strict Semver</a> for our Serverless Framework versioning. This way you’ll know when we introduce major features or breaking changes.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Function metrics, easier AWS credential setup, and Lambda versioning in Serverless Framework v1.3","date":"December 02, 2016","description":"Function metrics, easier AWS credential setup, and Lambda versioning now available in Serverless v1.3"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2016-12-02-serverless-v1.3.0/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2016-11-30-serverless-notifications-on-aws/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to build a serverless notification system on AWS"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2016-12-05-recap-serverless-announcements-reinvent/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"2016 AWS re:Invent Recap - Serverless Christmas came early"}}}}}
