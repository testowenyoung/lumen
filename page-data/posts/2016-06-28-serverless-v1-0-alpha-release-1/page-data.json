Serverless Framework V.1 features strong extensibility through a new <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/v1.0/docs/using-plugins\">Plugin System</a> and the ability to work with multiple providers from the start, though this release focuses purely on AWS.  We already have most of the functionality that was available in 0.x reimplemented with many optimizations to the developer experience going forward. With all those new plans coming we decided that this is our time to introduce breaking changes, so from V1.0 onwards we can improve incrementally. We will provide more information, documentation and direct help to our community going forward to transition from 0.X of Serverless to 1.x. The new system is very easy to set up and should be fast to reconfigure. We will release more alpha versions over the next weeks and months until we finally release the stable version of Serverless V1.0. We want to include you early on in this process for feedback and you can see the direction and help us on the way. We already have most of the functionality that was available in 0.x reimplemented and will put a special focus on developer tooling and developer experience going forward. With all of that said let’s dig into Setting up a new “serverless service”, a new and fundamental concept in V.1.</p>\n<h2>Introducing The “Serverless Service”</h2>\n<p>A “serverless service” is one or multiple functions (FaaS, Lambda, etc.), grouped together, with their resource/infrastructure requirements.  Services should only contain functions that are related (e.g., functions for CRUD operations on a data resource, or functions for a workflow, like a data processing pipeline), or functions that all depend on the same infrastructure resource (e.g., DynamoDB table, S3 bucket).   By grouping these related functions together, they are easier to develop and deploy.  These services are also designed to be autonomous units, which helps teams involved in larger projects own and work on serverless services independently, without blocking each other.   In Serverless Framework V.1, there are only services, instead of projects or single functions.  The “serverless service” represents the optimal level of organization.</p>\n<h2>Setting up Serverless Service</h2>\n<p>We will walk you through all the steps necessary to set up a service with AWS as the provider, invoke it, add events and custom resources and then remove it again. For more detailed documentation you can check out <a href=\"http://v1.docs.serverless.com\">our docs</a>. At first we need to install serverless of course. You can do this by running the following command. It will automatically install the latest Alpha version of Serverless.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">npm install -g serverless@alpha</code></pre></div>\n<p>To get an overview on the available commands and the plugins that are currently loaded you can check out the help:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">serverless --help</code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/legacy/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-24-15.05.29.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-06-24 15.05.29\"></p>\n<h2>Create a new Service</h2>\n<p>Let’s create a new service. You need to set the <strong>nam**</strong>e** and <strong>provider</strong> for a specific service.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">serverless create --name first-service --provider aws</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will create a subfolder <strong>first-service</strong> with the necessary files for your Node.js service. At the moment we only support Node.js in this alpha, but other languages will follow. <img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/legacy/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-24-15.05.05.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-06-24 15.05.05\"> This will create the following simple serverless.yml file for deployment, the file that declares and describes a serverless service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yaml\"><pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">service</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> first<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>service\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">provider</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> aws\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">functions</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">hello</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">handler</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> handler.hello</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Deploy the Service</h2>\n<p>Now that we have created the new service lets deploy it to AWS. The new implementation of Serverless on AWS builds completely on CloudFormation. When we deploy a serverless service, a new CloudFormation stack gets created and functions get updated through that Stack. You can check out the details of the AWS Deployment <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/tree/v1.0/lib/plugins/aws/deploy\">in our documentation</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">serverless deploy</code></pre></div>\n<p>Following is the log output during the deployment. We’re also working on having a little nicer output during the deployment so we don’t repeat the same message: <img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/legacy/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-24-16.03.09.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-06-24 16.03.09\"></p>\n<h2>Invoke the function with test data</h2>\n<p>Now we can invoke the function with some test data and see the results. We’re going to use the following json file for that</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token string\">\"data\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Brent Spiner\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">serverless invoke --function hello --path testfile.json</code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/legacy/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-24-16.08.38.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-06-24 16.08.38\"></p>\n<h2>Add other Events and Custom Resources</h2>\n<p>The serverless.yml doesn’t just allow you to add your functions, but also add events and custom resources to your stack. Events will be automatically translated into CloudFormation Resources. The resources section lets you define a custom CloudFormation template that we will use and extend, so you have full control over the infrastructure that is deployed. In the following example we’ve added a schedule event that will run the function every 10 minutes and an S3 bucket as a custom resource. You can read all about the events we currently support in our <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v1.0/docs/using-plugins/core-plugins.md\">AWS Events documentation</a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yml\"><pre class=\"language-yml\"><code class=\"language-yml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">service</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> first<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>service\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">provider</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> aws\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">functions</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">hello</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">handler</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> handler.hello\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">events</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">schedule</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> rate(10 minutes)\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">resources</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">Resources</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">MyBucket</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token key atrule\">Type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> AWS<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>S3<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>Bucket\n      <span class=\"token key atrule\">Properties</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"token key atrule\">BucketName</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"myserverlessbucket\"</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>After redeploying the service the function will be called every 10 minutes and the bucket will be created.</p>\n<h2>Remove A Service</h2>\n<p>Of course you can also remove a serverless service, which will remove the whole CloudFormation template, so nothing stays behind:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sh\"><pre class=\"language-sh\"><code class=\"language-sh\">serverless remove</code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/legacy/2016/06/Screenshot-2016-06-24-16.28.50.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2016-06-24 16.28.50\"></p>\n<h2>Next Steps for Serverless Framework V.1</h2>\n<p>Now that we’ve walked you through setting up a serverless service lets talk about the next steps we have planned.</p>\n<h3>Multi Provider Support</h3>\n<p>We’re currently working with Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure, IBM OpenWhisk and others to bring Serverless to many more providers. We believe the future of cloud infrastructure is cross provider and we want to make sure you have the same great experience with every one of them. Each provider has their own advantages and disadvantages and with the simplicity of Function as a Service and Serverless Architectures we’re getting to a place where it’s possible to use all of them together.</p>\n<h3>Local Developer Tooling</h3>\n<p>We want our community to have the best local developer experience possible. From working on services offline to easily and automatically deploying them into your functions while developing. With great insights into logs and metrics and good debugging support we will make sure you really know and understand your functions and your infrastructure while you’re developing it. Now that we have the first iteration of the serverless tooling out there this is one of the most important steps we want to take.</p>\n<h2>How to Contribute</h2>\n<p>With that first release of Serverless V1.0 we want to get more feedback from the community.
