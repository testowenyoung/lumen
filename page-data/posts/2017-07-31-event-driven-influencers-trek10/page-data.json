Emit has some of the most prominent speakers and sponsors in the field, and in this five-part ‘Influencers’ series we’re highlighting their contributions. Want to know more about where we think event-driven architectures will be in two years? <a href=\"http://www.emitconference.com\">Join us on August 17</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Jared Short is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shortjared?lang=en\">self-proclaimed</a> “purveyor of the bleeding edge.” But hey. We’ve known that for a while.</p>\n<p>He’s the Director of Innovation at <a href=\"https://www.trek10.com/\">Trek10</a>, who coincidentally is the first <a href=\"https://serverless.com/partners/\">Serverless Partner</a> company we ever accepted into the program. They have been active contributors to our GitHub and maintain a <a href=\"https://www.trek10.com/blog/\">fantastic blog</a>. At Trek10, they saw immediately that building serverless apps was a way to take on minimal development overhead, and still produce a fine-tuned piece of software that would infinitely scale in production.</p>\n<p>They have created apps for clients (from small business to enterprise) that do tens of millions of hits per day—all built on serverless infrastructure. So, they have a lot of proof to go off of when they say that going serverless has <a href=\"https://serverless.com/learn/graphql-and-serverless/\">cut their infrastructure development time</a> in half. </p>\n<h2>Looking to the Future</h2>\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-air-episode-two/\">interviewed Jared</a> in May, he was telling us about the way companies are skipping over the container trend and moving straight into serverless, because event-driven applications are a breath of fresh air. A developer can say, “Look, here’s my code…just run it in response to these particular events, exactly when I need them, at the scale I need them at.”</p>\n<p>Serverless computing makes it make more sense to focus on action and reaction. When companies think in terms of events, they can design more along the lines of: Okay, when a user clicks ‘delete account’, we want to get a notification to a specific Slack channel and we want to trigger this specific email survey to them. </p>\n<p>As for where serverless will be in a few more years? An event-driven mindset means Trek10 can continue to release better, more reactive apps. As they saw early on, actions carry the value.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Event-driven Influencers - Trek10","date":"August 02, 2017","description":"Keeping with the serverless pulse."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2017-07-31-event-driven-influencers-trek10/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2017-07-31-event-driven-influencers-aws-lambda/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Event-driven Influencers - AWS Lambda"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2017-08-02-serverless-v1.19.0/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Serverless v1.19 - Enhancements, bug fixes and tweaks added"}}}}}
