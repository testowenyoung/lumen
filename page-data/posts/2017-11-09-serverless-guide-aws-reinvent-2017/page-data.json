Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre in for.</p>\n<p>The venues are pretty spread out, so getting from one to the other can be time-consuming. Try to plan your day such that you stay in the same building if you can.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs tempting to be ambitious and keep your days jam packed, but really, don‚Äôt wear yourself out. Aim to hit 3-4 sessions a day. If you‚Äôre familiar with serverless already, stick with the 300+ level classes. The 200s tend to be more basic. </p>\n<p>Remember that the biggest value you‚Äôll get out of re:Invent are the conversations you‚Äôll have there. So during the breaks, meet people! We really can‚Äôt emphasize this one enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Go to the keynotes.</strong> This one‚Äôs in bold for emphasis. All the cool announcements and launches at re:Invent are going to happen during the keynotes. You probably don‚Äôt want to miss these.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre predicting AWS will have some surprise Lambda updates to talk about. Perhaps more event sources? New language runtimes? Longer time-outs?!</p>\n<h1>Serverless.com‚Äôs re:Invent Happy Hour</h1>\n<p>Did we mention we‚Äôre having our own happy hour? November 29th at the Rhumbar.</p>\n<p>Drinks! Swag!
