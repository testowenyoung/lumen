Today, we’re bringing it out of Beta, renaming it to <a href=\"https://serverless.com/enterprise/\">Serverless Framework Enterprise</a> and introducing a handful of new features that empower developer teams to build amazing serverless applications.</p>\n<p>Check it out <a href=\"https://serverless.com/enterprise/\">here</a> to get access.</p>\n<video autoplay muted loop controls poster='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/serverless-framework-enterprise-release/FWE-video-start-image.png'>\n    <source src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/serverless-framework-enterprise-release/serverless-framework-enterprise-dashboard-overview-SMALL.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\n</video>\n<p>The serverless movement was never supposed to be about needing multiple tools to build and operate your applications. Serverless is about doing more with less.</p>\n<p>What Serverless Framework users appreciate most is that it provides everything a developer needs to build and deploy their serverless application, in one simple, rich experience.</p>\n<p>Now, <strong>Serverless Framework Enterprise</strong> adds to that. It focuses on solving serverless operations problems for developer teams, with a richer experience, all while keeping it simple, so you can focus on results, not more tech complexity.</p>\n<p>Once you turn on Serverless Framework Enterprise, here’s what you get out-of-the-box…</p>\n<h4>Serverless Insights</h4>\n<p>Serverless applications are comprised of many functions and cloud services, which means they must be monitored differently than traditional applications.</p>\n<p>Serverless Framework Enterprise offers a solution for this by including a complete monitoring and alerting feature-set called <strong>Serverless Insights</strong>.</p>\n<p>Automagically upon deployment, your Functions will be instrumented to generate performance information and alerts, which can be viewed in the Serverless Framework Enterprise console.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/serverless-framework-enterprise-release/serverless-framework-enterprise-dashboard-overview.png\" alt=\"Serverless Framework Enterprise Dashboard\"></p>\n<p>The Enterprise console includes simple charts that you can click for low-level details. It also includes an Activity feed that will report alerts and events about your serverless application, like “Deployments,” “Unusual Invocation Rates,” and “New Error Detected”.</p>\n<p>When a new error is detected in your code, we’ll tell you about it immediately. We’ll even tell you where the error is.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/serverless-framework-enterprise-release/serverless-framework-enterprise-dashboard-error-alerts.png\" alt=\"Serverless Framework Enterprise Dashboard Error Alerts\"></p>\n<h4>Serverless Secrets</h4>\n<p>As our users ship increasing amounts of functions and applications, it becomes more difficult for them to manage their sensitive information, like credentials.</p>\n<p>Serverless Framework Enterprise ships with a solution for secrets management called <strong>Serverless Secrets</strong>, so your team can easily manage and delegate access to sensitive information your serverless applications require (e.g. access keys).</p>\n<p>You can create secrets within the Enterprise console and easily reference them via the Serverless Framework’s variable system.</p>\n<p>You can also create a special type of secret that gives the Serverless Framework temporary access to deploy to your Amazon Web Services account.</p>\n<p>Using this, the developers on your team and your CI/CD system do not need access credentials to your cloud account. All that’s needed is to add the AWS Secret to the “credentials” property in “serverless.yml”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/serverless-framework-enterprise-release/serverless-framework-enterprise-secrets.png\" alt=\"Serverless Framework Enterprise Secrets\"></p>\n<h4>Serverless Safeguards</h4>\n<p>Many organizations are seeking to standardize serverless development across their engineering teams. However, they need to ensure their developers are following best practices as well as organizational policies.</p>\n<p>Serverless Framework Enterprise includes its own policy engine called Serverless Safeguards. Safeguards enable managers and operations teams to configure policies that must be complied with, like “restricted-deploy-times,” “required-stack-tags,” or “no-overly-generous-iam-role-statements,” in order for a Serverless Framework deployment to succeed.</p>\n<p>Safeguards can be configured in the Enterprise console. There are over a dozen Safeguards that come out-of-the-box with Serverless Framework Enterprise, that will warn you if your application contains any well known architectural anti-patterns.\nThink of it as a linter for serverless applications.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/serverless-framework-enterprise-release/serverless-framework-enterprise-safeguards.png\" alt=\"Serverless Framework Enterprise Safeguards\"></p>\n<h4>Available Now</h4>\n<p>Serverless Framework Enterprise is available today. <a href=\"https://serverless.com/enterprise/\">Click here to get access</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Serverless Framework Enterprise: The Total Serverless Solution","date":"March 27, 2019","description":"The end-to-end tool for building and managing serverless applications."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2019-03-27-announcing-serverless-framework-enterprise/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-03-14-dynamic-image-resizing-nodejs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dynamic image resizing with Node.js and the Serverless Framework"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-04-05-framework-release-v140/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Serverless Framework v1.40"}}}}}
