At the time of writing this post, there are <strong>over 74 different products</strong> in the AWS admin console. SEVENTY-FOUR. Where to start?</p>\n<p>In this post, I’ll highlight resources I wish I knew existed when diving into the world of AWS.

Too many tutorials either beat around the bush, or come loaded down with industry jargon.</p>\n<p>Amazon Web Services in Plain English takes a no-nonsense approach to making AWS product offerings manageable and understandable.</p>\n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws\">Open Guides - AWS</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/aws-resources-post/media_1502238780216.jpg\" title=\"media_1502238780216.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>A boon of trustworthy and practical information and recommendations for a slew of AWS services</p>\n<p>Shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianleroux\">https://twitter.com/brianleroux</a> for pointing out this resource to me.</p>\n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://acloud.guru/\">A Cloud Guru</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://acloud.guru/\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/aws-resources-post/media_1502238817574.jpg\" title=\"media_1502238817574.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>A cloud guru is a vast library of cloud training material.</p>\n<p>Want to learn about AWS services? They got it.</p>\n<p>Want to learn about Serverless? They got it.</p>\n<p>Want to learn about DynamoDB? They have a freaking 23 hour course on it!</p>\n<p>If you enjoy learning via video, I’d highly recommend checking them out.</p>\n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/\">Cloud Academy</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/aws-resources-post/media_1502238876113.jpg\" title=\"media_1502238876113.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Cloud academy offers a ton of top notch video content as well, with a range of learning paths to take you from AWS newbie to AWS Neo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.blog.serverless.com/5+AWS+Resources+post/neo.jpg\" title=\"neo.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://github.com/SamVerschueren/alfred-aws\">Alfred AWS docs</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SamVerschueren/alfred-aws\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/blog/aws-resources-post/media_1502238930636.jpg\" title=\"media_1502238930636.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Alfred is one of my favorite productivity apps.
