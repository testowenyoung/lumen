Let’s take a look at the release highlights.</p>\n<h2>Highlights of 1.7.0</h2>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find a complete list of all the updates in the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">changelog</a>.</p>\n<h3>CloudWatch Events Support</h3>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to connect custom CloudWatch rules to fire your Lambda functions?</p>\n<p>Serverless v1.7 has you covered and introduces the new <code class=\"language-text\">cloudwatchEvent</code> event source!</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of how the new <code class=\"language-text\">cloudwatchEvent</code> can be used:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yml\"><pre class=\"language-yml\"><code class=\"language-yml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">functions</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">notifier</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">handler</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> handler.notifier\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">events</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">cloudwatchEvent</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n          <span class=\"token key atrule\">event</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"token key atrule\">source</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n              <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"aws.ec2\"</span>\n            <span class=\"token key atrule\">detail-type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n              <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"EC2 Instance State-change Notification\"</span>\n            <span class=\"token key atrule\">detail</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n               <span class=\"token key atrule\">state</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n                 <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> pending</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can learn more about the new CloudWatch Event support in the <a href=\"https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/cloudwatch-event/\">corresponding documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Logging of Upcoming Deprecations</h3>\n<p>We heard you and we agree that introducing breaking changes can be pretty painful.</p>\n<p>With this release we introduce logging messages that will show you what breaking changes will be introduced in the next release (v1.8 in this case).</p>\n<p>You’ll see them by default after upgrading to the new Serverless version but you can also disable them if you don’t want to see them anymore.</p>\n<p>The idea here is to inform you about all the upcoming breaking changes coming in the next release.</p>\n<p>This should give you enough time to update your codebase so that Serverless will run smoothly.</p>\n<p>As usual we keep the breaking changes as minimal as possible so that updating from one version to the next shouldn’t be too hard.</p>\n<h3>Reduced Memory Footprint During Zipping</h3>\n<p>Serverless is increasingly being used in CI/CD systems. The resources (i.e. CPU or Memory) of those systems often tend to be limited.</p>\n<p>This release introduces a <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/3220\">one-line bug fix</a> that reduces the memory consumption during the zipping process by about ~40%.</p>\n<p>This should make it easier for you to use Serverless on a less powerful machine like a CI/CD system.</p>\n<h3>Enhancements &#x26; Bug Fixes</h3>\n<p>We’ve also fixed some nasty bugs and introduced some enhancements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for reporting bugs and opening issues to improve Serverless!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Upcoming Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>Here’s a list of all the breaking changes that will be introduced in Serverless v1.8.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You’ll see the same list in the CLI if you run a Serverless command (as long as you haven’t disabled it).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/2983\">BREAKING - Replace IamPolicyLambdaExecution with inline policies and added ManagedPolicyArns to fix VPC permissions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/pull/3239\">BREAKING - Update function name displaying for info plugin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>You’ll always get the most recent list of breaking changes when you take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/serverless/serverless/milestones\">upcoming milestone</a> or in the Serverless CLI.</em></p>\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\n<p>This release contains lots of hard work from our awesome community and wouldn’t have been possible without passionate people contributing to Serverless.</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of all the contributors who’ve PR’d changes for this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Andrey Tserkus </li>\n<li>Bruno Belotti </li>\n<li>Chris Selmer </li>\n<li>Dan Caddigan </li>\n<li>Francesc Rosas </li>\n<li>James Andersen </li>\n<li>James Thomas </li>\n<li>Joey van Dijk </li>\n<li>Marc Abramowitz </li>\n<li>Nikos Katsikanis </li>\n<li>Steve Persch </li>\n<li>Vlad Golubev </li>\n<li>dan moore </li>\n<li>horike37</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Get Involved</h3>\n<p>Serverless has a really helpful, awesome and vibrant community.
