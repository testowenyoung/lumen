There are few rules, fewer resources; no guidelines about who, how or when to get stuff done; and near-constant uncertainty when it comes to your company’s future. </p>\n<p>This, friends, is my 3rd such startup. I’m a masochist, I know.</p>\n<p>On the bright side! These experiences have led me to come up with a conveniently corny acronym for thriving in such chaos: <strong>C.E.O.</strong> These goals might not ensure success, but they’ll at least give you a good shot at sanity. </p>\n<h1>Communication</h1>\n<p>For small teams, a product might literally change direction between a morning meeting and an afternoon coffee run. Communication is life.</p>\n<p>I won’t advocate for a certain magical set of tools to accomplish this, or get on my soapbox about how Slack is ruining work-life balance (both worthy conversations for another time), but I will stress that people should err on the side of <em>over</em>-communicating.</p>\n<p>Track decisions in a centralized, easily-accessible place. Say more than you think you need to say, and say it too much. Have all-hands meetings. We all eyeroll at meetings, but it’s better to embrace them than to have everyone losing their goalposts and focus.</p>\n<p>When in doubt, talk it out.</p>\n<h1>Expectations</h1>\n<p>Larger companies have established checks and balances. Deadlines run on longer cadences, responsibilities are clearly divvied up and everybody knows who’s Management and who’s a Plebian.</p>\n<p>Not so in startups; they prefer self-ownership and relatively flat management structures. It tends to result in divergent pathways and a team that’s grasping for guidance. It becomes incredibly important to define the <a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm\">5 Why’s</a> so everyone can set meaningful, achievable expectations. Checks and balances and whatnot.</p>\n<p>In a tiny company with no safety net, misalignments have huge consequences. Say you expect a co-worker to build a feature and they aren’t on the same page—missing that ship date can mean the difference between life and death for a startup.</p>\n<p>The more chaotic and fluid a company’s environment, the more crucial it is that expectations are <em>crystal</em> clear.</p>\n<h1>Ownership</h1>\n<p>All of this (over)communication and expectations-setting doesn’t mean a thing if people aren’t also taking ownership. And when I say that, I intend ownership to mean more than “accountability”. Plenty of people can be accountable and totally disengaged from the process.</p>\n<p>Ownership means sometimes stepping outside of the bounds of what you’re directly accountable for—lending a helping hand, or even stepping in. In a startup, this can mean everything from making sure the snacks are stocked to helping a colleague ship that last feature in time for a deadline.</p>\n<p>No matter the scenario, a true owner takes pride in the company’s output and doesn’t balk at making sh*t happen.</p>\n<h1>Wrap up</h1>\n<p>In short, everyone should be a mini CEO. Communicate more, set expectations well, and take ownership wherever possible. That next round of funding is just around the corner.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Embrace the mini CEO","date":"October 19, 2017","description":"Lessons learned in avoiding startup chaos.
